##  Setup Guide

### 1. Install Node.js and Mountebank

Open terminal and run:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
npm install -g npm@8.4.1
npm install -g mountebank
npm audit fix
```

---

### 2. Start Mountebank Server

From the project root:

```bash
mb --configfile imposters.ejs --ip 0.0.0.0
```

- Admin UI: `http://localhost:2525`
- Mock API: `http://localhost:2727`

---

### 3. Configure API Base URL in App

#### a. Emulator

```kotlin
 val BASE_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:2727"
```

#### b. Physical Device

1. Ensure laptop and device are on the same Wi-Fi.
2. Find your laptopâ€™s IP (e.g., `192.168.0.102`).
3. Update base URL:

```kotlin
 val BASE_URL = "http://192.168.0.102:2727"
```

> Make sure firewall allows incoming traffic on port `2727`.

### 4. Build & Run the App

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Select your target (emulator or device).
3. Run the app. It should fetch data from the Mountebank server.
